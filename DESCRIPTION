Description: 
    The `TVDPathAlgo` package implements a path-following algorithm for solving 
    Total Variation Denoising (TVD) problems. It efficiently computes solutions for 
    a sequence of regularization parameters (`lambda`) while tracking the knots 
    (change points) in the resulting piecewise constant solution. The package 
    provides tools for both algorithmic exploration and testing of intermediate 
    solutions.
