\title{Rank Solutions by Total Cost}
\usage{
solutions_cost(result, y, alpha = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{A list returned by the \code{path_algo} function, containing lambda values,
beta values, and other related outputs.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing the input signal.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value between 0 and 1, specifying the weight of noise reduction
in the total cost. Defaults to 0.5.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing:
\describe{
\item{lambda}{Lambda values corresponding to each solution.}
\item{noise_reduction}{Computed noise reduction for each solution.}
\item{signal_preservation}{Computed signal preservation for each solution.}
\item{total_cost}{Total cost for each solution, balancing noise reduction and signal preservation.}
\item{rank}{The rank of each solution based on total cost, with 1 being the best.}
}
}
\description{
This function ranks solutions generated by the \code{path_algo} function based on total cost,
balancing noise reduction and signal preservation. The total cost is calculated as
a weighted sum of noise reduction and signal preservation, with weights determined
by the \code{alpha} parameter.

# Example usage with dummy data

result <- path_algo(y, lambda_0 = 100, method = "tri")
ranked_results <- solutions_cost(result, y, alpha = 0.5)
